https://sonu-fashion.herokuapp.com/ <---hosted project, its a little slow because of the free herokuapp so it might take some time loading up data or a reload of the page. when checking out sign up with an email and password then use that to sign in right after.

on checkout page use:
e-mail: guest@guest.com
password: 123456

or sign up once you hit enter login with the same info the mlab database is slow so you might have to relogin a couple times

thanks Gurjot

Created this project using: Front-end: react react-router-dom redux css font awesome

Back-end: axios express mongoDB mongoose passport bcrypt cors

I personaly designed it myself to show my ability to create the front end while adding authentication and storing custom data, usernames and cookies that keep track of each user that is created and what is in there cart.
